# DevOps Task
### In this devops task, I was asked to run and stand up two containers at the same time. I created an image file for the web-server and created a container using that image file. For Mssql, I used the necessary image file in the docker-compose file and created a container using that image. Then, to get these containers up and running, I first ran the "docker compose build" and then the "docker compose up -d" commands. 

### Then I observed that it was working via;
```
http://localhost:80/
```
